# Script usage

```bash
$ node ./scripts/periodic-yield.js <ADDRESS> <LATEST_EOD_TIMESTAMP> <PERIODS> <SECONDS_PER_PERIOD>
```

-   `ADDRESS` is a case-insensitive WrappedM holder address
-   `LATEST_EOD_TIMESTAMP` is the Unix/block timestamp that demarcates the end of the most recent period
-   `PERIODS` is the number of recent periods to return earned yield values for
-   `SECONDS_PER_PERIOD` defines how long a period is in seconds

# Requirements

An `.env` file is require in the root (in the same directory as `subgraph.yaml`) that defines `API_ENDPOINT` and `API_PATH`.
